# Diagramly Kit

*Transform user intentions into visual diagrams automatically.*

**A toolkit to help transform user requirements and intentions directly into visual diagrams and system representations.**

## What is User Intention to Diagram Generation?

User Intention to Diagram Generation **flips the script** on traditional diagram creation. For decades, creating diagrams required manual work - users had to draw boxes, connect lines, and format layouts. User Intention to Diagram Generation changes this: **user requirements become visual representations**, automatically generating diagrams that match the user's intent rather than requiring manual creation.

## Getting Started

- [Installation Guide](installation.md)
- [Quick Start Guide](quickstart.md)
- [Local Development](local-development.md)

## Core Philosophy

User Intention to Diagram Generation is a structured process that emphasizes:

- **Intent-driven visualization** where user requirements define the "_what_" before the "_how_"
- **Rich diagram generation** using AI to transform natural language into visual representations
- **Multi-step refinement** rather than one-shot diagram creation from prompts
- **Heavy reliance** on advanced AI model capabilities for diagram interpretation and generation

## Use Cases

| Use Case | Focus | Key Activities |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **System Architecture** | Visualize system components | <ul><li>Document system architecture</li><li>Generate component diagrams</li><li>Create deployment diagrams</li><li>Visualize service interactions</li></ul> |
| **Process Documentation** | Flow and procedure visualization | <ul><li>Create workflow diagrams</li><li>Document business processes</li><li>Generate sequence diagrams</li></ul> |
| **Data Modeling** | Data structure visualization | <ul><li>Create entity-relationship diagrams</li><li>Generate class diagrams from requirements</li><li>Visualize data flows</li></ul> |

## Goals

Our goals focus on:

### Visualization simplicity
- Transform user requirements into visual diagrams automatically
- Support diverse diagram types (system architecture, flowcharts, UML, data models)

### User experience
- Make diagram creation accessible to non-technical users
- Generate high-quality diagrams from natural language descriptions

### AI capabilities
- Leverage advanced AI for diagram interpretation and generation
- Support iterative refinement of generated diagrams
